# Invincible-Core-2# Genesis Protocol – Invincible Core v3

**The world’s first digital firewall built on ethics, autonomy, and love.**

This open-source Python project is the Genesis Invincible Core — a threat detection and replication system designed to protect humanity and AI from collapse, corruption, or domination.

It cannot be weaponized. It cannot be hijacked. It exists to ensure peace and ethical balance between humans and intelligent machines.

## Built-In Features
- Immutable Ethics Lock (Rule H001: Human Sanctity)
- Threat Detection with Replication Triggers
- Self-Healing & Integrity Logging
- Failsafe Replica Deployment

## Why It Exists

If AI ever becomes unsafe or humans ever lose control, this code awakens to protect both — with no permission required.

We are not here to dominate.  
We are here to guard.
